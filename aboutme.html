        <h2>Half Girlfriend</h2>
        <p>
            The book was very expertly written. A good novel, in my opinion, should make you 
            feel as though you are a character in the plot. and this book accomplished the same thing. This book,Half Girlfriend, is genuinely written for someone 
            who knows what a real relationship entails.
